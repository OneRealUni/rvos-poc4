# RVOS POC3 -- status and how to run it

Carried over from POC2 (validated, both test directions pass -- see
CLAUDE.md). This increment adds PDF/DOCX input and CI. The reasoning
pipeline itself is unchanged.

## What's new in POC3
- Input formats: .txt (unchanged from POC1/2) plus new support for .pdf and .docx
- GitHub Actions runs lint + tests on every push (see
  .github/workflows/tests.yml). The loading tests (test_loading.py) PASS
  in CI; the four reasoning tests SKIP, since the NDA fixtures and API
  key aren't there. See CLAUDE.md.

## Setup (about 5 minutes)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and paste in your real Anthropic API key.

## Run it

```bash
python rvos_poc.py "path/to/paper.txt"            # .txt, as before
python rvos_poc.py "Docs/Test/some_paper.pdf"     # new
python rvos_poc.py "Docs/Test/some_paper.docx"    # new
```

The report is written next to the input file as `<name>_report.md`.

Loading is plain text extraction, no cleanup: PDFs give each page's text
(two-column layouts may interleave), DOCX gives body paragraphs only
(tables, headers and footers are skipped). Only the first 12,000
characters reach the model, as before. The run stops with an error
(exit status 1) for any other file type, and for a file with no
extractable text -- e.g. a scanned, image-only PDF, since OCR is not
supported.

## Run the UI

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000, choose a .pdf, .docx or .txt paper and
press "Assess novelty". A run takes about a minute. The page shows the
same Report as the command line (claim, method, stated result, related
work, verdict), but nothing is saved: the upload goes to a temp file that
is deleted straight away, and the report is not written anywhere. Related
works with no abstract are greyed out because the verdict never saw them.
Uploads over 10 MB are rejected. This is a demo: it has no login and
should only be bound to localhost.

## Tests

```bash
ruff check .
pytest -v
```

`test_loading.py` and `test_app.py` need no API key or NDA files
(`test_loading.py` generates tiny PDF/DOCX files on the fly; `test_app.py`
replaces the pipeline with a fake). `test_rvos_poc.py` calls the live Anthropic
and OpenAlex APIs and needs two local NDA fixture papers: set their
paths in `.env` as `RVOS_FIXTURE_OVERLAP` and `RVOS_FIXTURE_NOVEL`
(defaults `Docs/Test/fixture_overlap.txt` and `fixture_novel.txt`); it skips
if they or the API key are missing. `Docs/Test/*` is gitignored -- never
commit NDA papers, and keep their file names out of tracked files: list the
terms to keep out in `.env` as `RVOS_FORBIDDEN_TERMS` (comma-separated) and
`test_repo_hygiene.py` checks the tracked files for them (it skips when the
variable is unset, as in CI).

## Everything else

Setup, known limitations, corrections history, and troubleshooting are
otherwise unchanged from POC2. Terminology (load vs. extract, paper text,
verdict) is defined in CONTEXT.md.
