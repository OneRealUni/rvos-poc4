"""
RVOS demo web app: upload a paper, get the Report back on screen.

A thin wrapper around rvos_poc.py, which is not modified here. Calls
build_graph().invoke() directly rather than run(), because run() writes a
file and returns nothing. Demo only: no auth, no storage, one user.

Run:
    uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
